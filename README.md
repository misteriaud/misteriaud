## More about me

<details>
  <summary>Skills</summary>

### Soft skills
- Committed to a methodical approach (don't like to jump right into coding to end up with spaghetti code).
- Emphasis on effective team communication.

### Hard skills
#### Languages
- **C** and **C++**: memory allocation, I/O system calls, parallelism, and concurrency implementations.
- **Python**: used only for small tools projects.
- **Typescript**: used for many side-projects.

#### Useful knowledge
- Basic Linux administration knowledge (installation, packet installation, `sudo` authorization).
- `Makefile` writing.
- `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` writing.
- Skills in domain name administration and cloud management (e.g., running instances, setting up load-balancer, "serverless" functions).

#### Next on my learning list
I'm interested in these techs:
- **Rust**: to work on distributed safe software, and to learn WASM concepts.
- **Elixir**: `BEAM VM` appears to be powerful, and the Elixir functional programming paradigm attracts me.

## Call to Action
I'm currently looking for a 6-month internship. My ideal internship would be working on a distributed software, written in Rust, in another country than France to discover other ways of team working.
